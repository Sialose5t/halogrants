# IoTeX Halo Grants Program
ðŸ‘Ÿ Apply for a IoTeX Halo Grant. Help build the IoTeX ecosystem!

## Goals
The IoTeX Halo Program, runs by the IoTeX Foundation, funds community projects benefiting the IoTeX community. At a high level, we welcome two categories of proposals, tech or non-tech:
- **RFP (Requests for Proposals)** which define a scope of work and funding limit. In some instances we may fund multiple teams to work independently on solutions to the same RFP.
- **OEP (Open-ended Proposals)** which is an open program that incentize proposing innovative and impactful ideas for our ecosystem.

## Types of Grants
Recommended proposal types include, but are not limited to: 
- Infrastructure, e.g., wallet, DEX, datastore
- Developer Experience (DX), e.g., tools and sofeware to make dev's life easier
- Products, e.g., IoT gagets, mobile apps, game, 
- Education
- Marketing
- Public relations
- Community activities.

## How to Apply
1. Anyone (individuals or teams) is welcomed to submit their proposals via pull requests to this repo (follow the given templates here and here); once committed, please submit the content to community.iotex.io for open discussions.
2. The commitee will review the PR within two weeks, provide feedback/suggestions, optionally schedule a call with the team, and approve/reject finally. We will expand our commitee as time goes by, by inviting relevant techonologists and influceners.
3. If a grant is awarded, grant recipients will receive their IOTX grants periodically based on predetermined milestones for the specific grant. 
4. Grant recipients will be required to produce Milestone Reports (follow the given template here) in order to continue to receive grant funding. If the Milestone Report is showing that the initiative is not meeting expectations, the Foundation has the option to halt continued funding. The submission cycle of the Milestone Report will vary according to each projectâ€™s duration.

## Eligibility
1. Proposal should be clear about how they would benefit IoTeX ecosystem and we are primarily interested in projects that can be completed in 3 months or less.
2. Teams can apply for grants more than once, but they need to complete the previous project (as described in their application) before receiving additional funds. 
3. Teams shouldnâ€™t seek to cover 100% of their early-stage funding via W3F Grants alone.
