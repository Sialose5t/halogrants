### Dashboard to track Halo Projects

While we track progress of every Halo projects on Github to achieve the highest transparency, it would be great to have a nice dashboard to track projects visually and user-friendly. The required features are
- automatic tracking and visualization of applications
- automatic tracking and visualization of milestones of projects
- automatic tracking and visualization of project traction, e.g., DAU, daily active txs and so on

### Online IDE ###
An online IDE for development of smart contract and to interate with IoTeX blockchain is a long-awaited product! We have had the basic version of IoTeX IDE (http://ide.iotex.io/) up and running, which still lacks many desired features. One needs to iterate on top of the open-source-d IDE to make it a full-fledged product for all developers including the core-dev! Some of the desired features are:
- compile (of either local and remote smart contract files) and deploy the bytecodes to IoTeX mainnet and testnet
- support read from and write to a contract in a user-friendly way
- support extended instructions of EVM that IoTeX implemented (bonus!)

&nbsp;

### Stable Coins ###
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to minimize the volatility of the price of the stablecoin, relative to some "stable" asset or basket of assets. There are couple of ways to develop a stable coin on IoTeX and we are open to all:
- crosschain-transferring of stable coins from Ethereum (and other blockchains) to IoTeX blockchain
- natively issue a stable coin on IoTeX blockchain which can be pegged to a cryptocurrency, fiat money, or to exchange-traded commodities (such as precious metals or industrial metals). This one can be asset-backed or seigniorage-style.

&nbsp;

### Decentralized Exchange ###
A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a cryptocurrency exchange which operates in a decentralized way, i.e., without a central authority. Decentralized exchanges allow peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies. Since IoTeX supports EVM and solidity (and super fast!), it would be possible to launch a DEX on top of IoTeX blockchain. DEX could come with orderbooks (e.g., DDEX) or not (e.g., Uniswap) but should be secure, fast and convinent for people to use.

&nbsp;

### Hardware Wallet Support ###
A hardware wallet is a special type of cryptocurrency wallet which stores the user's private keys in a secure hardware device. They have major advantages over standard software wallets: private keys are often stored in a protected area of a microcontroller, and cannot be transferred out of the device in plaintext. While core-dev is working with Ledger closely to lauch IOTX wallet for nano S/X wallets, we desire to support native IOTX on other hardware wallets such as Trezor, KeepPay and many others. Help us develop firmwarre for mainstream hardware wallets!
