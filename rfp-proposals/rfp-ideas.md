### Dashboard to track IoTeX Halo Projects

While we track progress of every Halo projects on Github to achieve the highest transparency, it would be great to have a nice dashboard to track projects visually and user-friendly. The required features are
- automatic tracking and visualization of applications
- automatic tracking and visualization of milestones of projects
- automatic tracking and visualization of project traction, e.g., DAU, daily active txs and so on

### Online IDE ###
An online IDE for development of smart contract and to interate with IoTeX blockchain is a long-awaited product! We have had the basic version of IoTeX IDE (http://ide.iotex.io/) up and running, which still lacks many desired features. One needs to iterate on top of the open-source-d IDE to make it a full-fledged product for all developers including the core-dev! Some of the desired features are:
- compile (of either local and remote smart contract files) and deploy the bytecodes to IoTeX mainnet and testnet
- support read from and write to a contract in a user-friendly way
- support extended instructions of EVM that IoTeX implemented (bonus!)
