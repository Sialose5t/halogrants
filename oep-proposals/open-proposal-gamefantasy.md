### Project Description
---
As we all know, because blockchain and smart contract can provide Ani-cheat, almost blockchain games are gambling games. However, there is a problem that so many conditions were defined in contract having a bad effect on the game process. Because every game currency trading will be resent if status was modified. A good game experience should allow players to achieve a consistent and continuity progress. In order to allowing players to achieve better game experience in the future, blockchain game should not be limited to gambling games.
Games can be design in centralized. But decentralization is mainly used in currency and point card. To recharge favorite game by token can largely shows the value of token. Although online games just one of entertainments for people, but what we need to do is making games have more possible.

### Value
---
That will be the best choice for blockchain online games in this way. As mentioned above,
An excellent game can referral traffic by taken payment, and then increase transaction volume and token usage. Games can only focus on the entertainment and provides the best experience for player. But during the process, the value of token will be increase more. 
Taking a step back, it will not any other risks if this method cannot be accepted by market.
The main difficulty of this project is to make our games run normally in various web environments and to recharge with the blockchain normally. However, I believe that there is technical support for the project, at least there is no problem in the interaction of the chain.

### Deliverables
---
The game will deliver html5casual games mechanisms running within the page. Of course, make sure the game can run well is our responsibility. At least 80% of the bugs are fixed before the officially online, but it does not affect the player's experience of the entire game. Players can recharge and pay within the game by iotx or vita.
