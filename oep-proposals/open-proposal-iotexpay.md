**Name of Project:** IoTeXPay for WooCommerce

**Proposal Category:** Infrastructure

**Proposer:** `metanyx`

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP?:** YES

# Project Description

To create a WooCommerce plugin for IoTeX to allow merchants to accept and user to pay for goods with IOTX or other tokens that may exist on IoTeX network in the future (Stable Coins)

- Build a plugin for WooCommerce to take IOTX as payment
- Compatible with IOPay and associated IOTEX Antenna JS
- Use CoinMarket Cap API to derive associated local currency with IOTX market price (USD --> IOTX on the fly conversion)


## Value

Creating the foundation for IoTeX to be used as a cryptocurrency integrated with WooCommerce (Wordpress). There are currently over 3 million E-commerce sites that are powered by WooCommerce. By developing an integration for WooCommerce will demonstrate the speed of the IoTeX Blockchain that can achieve transaction finality in 5 seconds making it a viable alternative to Credit Card processing.

IOTEXPay will provide exposure to the IoTeX Blockchain by a larger community of users if integrated with WooCommerce. Integration with IOPay which is currently a desktop wallet rather than a Chrome Extension could cause some complexity for the user.

- Ability for merchant to install plugin
