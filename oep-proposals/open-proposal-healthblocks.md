# Project Description

Modern western societies have been in a health crisis even before the outbreak of the corona pandemic. Just like all Western societies also in the Netherlands over 50% of the adults suffer from chronic diseases. The average age at which the first chronic disease develops is 40,7 years for men and 37,8 years for women. Over 50% of the adult Dutch population are overweight and for children it is 12%. At the current trajectory our healthcare expenditure will double in the next 20 years to 174 billion euro’s annually in 2040. By that time the Dutch healthcare system is bankrupt. 

There is hope to convert this pale outlook because 30% of the healthcare cost is preventable. Living a healthier lifestyle shows to be one of the most promising ways to age in a healthy way and keep our healthcare system alive. Our healthcare systems are currently built to be reactive. What if we shift our focus from reactive to proactive healthcare. Technology allows us to start gathering health data at our homes while we are still in good shape. Storing this data and analyzing trends gives us the opportunity to get a better insight in our health status and keep us healthy.

Perhaps the most important issue when it comes to tracking and analyzing your health is privacy. Data is generated through various applications and devices, and in most cases, you don’t own the data. Another problem is that the data isn’t collected in one secure place where analysis can be performed in a trusted fashion. You have snippets of health data that are held by diverse companies. If you have one secure place where all your health and lifestyle data is stored and can be analyzed by a trusted application you unlock new levels of privacy as well as the opportunity to enjoy more healthy years.

With HealthBlocks we introduce health as a service. HealthBlocks is a health service that that pro-actively helps you to track your health status. Once you subscribe to the service you will receive a HealthBox that contains 4 IoT health devices to track your health (biomarkers) on a regular basis. Lifestyle data from other applications such as Strava, Runkeeper, Apple Health etc are also loaded into the HealthBlocks app. Mental health questionnaires are also part of health data that you generate by using the app. Every 3 months you have a digital appointment with the lifestyle doctor (HealthBlocks Doctor). Together with the HB doc, you run through your health data and discuss your health status based on the data that you generated! 

In the application you are invited to do different challenges such as a daily mile, one month without alcohol and many others, that can benefit your health. With HealthBlocks you can start tracking your health and experiment what works for you. 

## Value

Preventive healthcare is an opportunity that will benefit humanity. However we want health data to be in the hands of the rightful owner, you. More and more devices are coming into the market that aren’t private by design. We want to build the HealthBlocks platform as a service where you own your data and where we can perform analytics on your data in a trusted fashion. 

If we don’t get this right and the total collection of health data will not be trusted we miss an opportunity to give people more power over their own data and lives. In the recent years there is an increasing interest in health related data by various companies and organizations for example (healthcare) insurers, research organizations, corporates, tech companies and governments. Because health is becoming the new wealth most often materialized in health data. Therefore, it’s of great importance that the total collection of one’s health data is trusted and people can make their own choice with who they share that data and how they leverage that value.  

The greatest risks and challenges for HealthBlocks is to make the system as trusted as possible. First, we will make the total collection of data trusted, that’s more of a technical challenge we believe we can solve together with IoTeX. 
However, our ambition is to make the entire system trusted in the long term. To do that we have to work together with the device manufacturers and build a line of hardware devices that are powered by IoTeX. Although this can be a challenge we believe in the shared vision of IoTeX and HealthBlocks and are confident we can find ways to make that happen. 

## Deliverables

Our final deliverable is that we build a trusted service application that will support our organization by providing an infrastructure for health as a service. With the purpose to help people to enjoy more healthy years.
